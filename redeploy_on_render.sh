# get current postgres instance
# delete current postgres instance
# create new postgres instance (DB name from env var)

# wait??? or maybe employ a retry loop that try to fetch DB address

# go to each project and replace env var for internal DB address with newly fetched address

# wait???? maybe run a get request for each project and see if we get a 200 back?
